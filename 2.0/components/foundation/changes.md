### Version 2.0.0

* Convert `Orchestra\Core` to `Orchestra\App`.
* Add `Orchestra\App::handle()` to emulate `(:bundle)` routing structure in Laravel 3.
* Deprecate and remove `Orchestra`, alias to `Orchestra\App`, instead introduce `orchestra()` helper function as a replacement.
* Validations now using services, based on `Orchestra\Support\Validator`.
* Menu are now using `Orchestra\Services\Event\AdminMenuHandler`.
* `Orchestra\Mail` are now utilising Laravel 4 `Mail` class, `Orchestra\Mail::send()` would choose either to use basic send or queue based on Orchestra Platform setting.

* Update to Twitter Bootstrap 3.

* Remove `Form::token()` as it's automatically added by `Form::open()`.

* Fixed invalid generated URL to delete users.
* Add `Orchestra\Testbench` package to help unit testing controllers.
* Allow `handles('orchestra::/')` to alias `handles('orchestra/foundation::/')`.
